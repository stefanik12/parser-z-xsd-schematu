#summary Project description and final Statement

== Final Summary ==
=== Development organisation ===
This project was first supposed to be developed in cooperation of four team members. Yet since *SVN revision 40* deployment other team members have resigned and the whole development process was managed only by me (Michal Štefánik).
<br><br>
I hereby declare that, all the following parts of Project are my personal work: 
<br>-all the source codes of the application core (Main, Binder, Marshaler) (package 'source'),
<br>-all the testing sources (package 'input'), except complexXML.xml a complexXSD.xsd (randomly gathered from the internet, source: [http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/xml/schema/ch02_01.htm]),
<br>-JUnit tests for Binder
<br>-Interfaces attached to output, implemented by generated classes (SimpleType, ComplexType)

=== Development description ===
Since that first partial implementation of the application has too high complexities, and many bugs (as indicated by existing JUnit tests), I have decided to start the implementation from scratch. <br>
Objective decomposition of the new solution is obviously inspired by JAXB: application core consists of classes: Binder and Marshaler (detailed in [https://code.google.com/p/parser-z-xsd-schematu/wiki/Analyza]). <br>
Static method in Binder class are crucial for correct application functionality and therefore their correctness is extra verified by JUnit tests.
Major methods bind() in Binder and marshal() in Marshaleri profusely use tested methods and are not tested itself. Their correctness is verified by a valid and syntax-correct output of the application. <br>
To enable automatic testing of Project were attached testing XML Schemas and Documents (package 'input').<br>
To ease possible further development above this application, together with the generated classes are attached their interfaces (SimpleType, ComplexType, ParserInterface).
